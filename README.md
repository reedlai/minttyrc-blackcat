# minttyrc-blackcat
The blackcat is a black background colour theme for mintty. It comes with a block cursor, golden for normal, complementary colour for IME. That is easy to my eyes, also easy to identify current input method.

There are two methods to use this theme. The first
1. copy the minttyrc-blackcat file into Cygwin folder /etc/
2. rename copied file name to minttyrc
3. restart mintty terminal

The other way
1. copy the minttyrc-blackcat file into Cygwin folder /usr/share/mintty/themes/
2. rename the copied file name to blackcat
3. put a line "ThemeFile=blackcat" in /etc/minttyrc file
4. restart mintty terminal
